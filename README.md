# ESP_Remote_Start

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p> Chevy wanted $15/month to be able to start/lock/unlock/find my wife's new car with an app. This is silly but pretty useful. Is it worth $15/month? No, no it's not.</p>
<p> What I have done is developed a website that is hosted on an ESP8266. Through this website a user can start, stop, lock, and unlock their vehicle. The website is also capable of scheduling remote-start times. This is great in the winter when you don't think about starting your vehicle until you walk out. Snow in the forecast tomorrow? Schedule a remote start 20 minutes before you leave from work to help the scraping process</p>
